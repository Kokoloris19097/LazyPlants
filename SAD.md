## 1. Introduction 
### 1.1 Purpose

using a number of different architectural views to depict different aspects of the system. 
It is intended to capture and convey the significant architectural decisions which have been made on the system.

## 2. Architectural Representation
[MVC] (https://gitlab.com/dhbwar1/dhbwar-docu/-/blob/master/MVC.png)

## 3.Architectural Goals and Constraints 
Since we use Andriod we dont use a generated MVC. It's important for us to seperate the view and the model, so we could replace the view easily (maybe for a PC-port).
