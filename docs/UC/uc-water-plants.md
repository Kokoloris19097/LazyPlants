# Use-Case Specification: Add Plant

## 1.1 Brief Description
The user can start the watering mechanism manually. When the moisture of the plant is low, the app shows you that the plant needs water and that you can water them. When there is enough moisture, you can't water your plant. This pervents that the user overwaters their plants.
